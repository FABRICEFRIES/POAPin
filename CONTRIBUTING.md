# Contributing to POAPin

⌐◨-◨- Thank you for your interest in POAPin, and please join us in making it better!

## Internationalization

We wish people all over the world to be able to use POAPin in a language they are familiar with. No one can master all languages, and it will take a long time to get the POAPin app to support multiple languages, but we believe we can get there soon with everyone's help!

Here's an example where you don't need to know how to code and can complete the entire task on the web. Very simple.

1. ### Locate the language file that you are familiar with ###

    Visit this folder: [`lib/common/translations/languages`](https://github.com/glorylab/POAPin/tree/master/lib/common/translations/languages)
    
    <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5019152/185751834-25c56510-6777-41d3-b82c-2c7d624e8f7e.png' height="360" />
    
    Here are the meanings of these language file names:
    
    https://github.com/glorylab/POAPin/blob/104f3aa3320b1b1a4ff27669eed973bac57a083f/lib/common/translations/locale_string.dart#L27-L40
    
2. ### Open the language you want to contribute to ###

    Here is an example in `🇯🇵Japanese🇯🇵`, let's open [`ja.dart`](https://github.com/glorylab/POAPin/blob/master/lib/common/translations/languages/ja.dart)
    
    Click the Edit button to enter the online editor.
    
    <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5019152/185752536-39702ea4-5112-47e9-8125-428dc4ae240c.png' height="200" />
    
    Find the text you can translate, remove the `//` at the beginning of a line and replace the second half of the line with the translation for the corresponding language. Replace `Home` with `ホーム`, for example:
    
    <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5019152/185752776-69f864f9-fc55-468e-97bd-ee0a75fc945e.png' height="100" />
    
    That's it!
    
3. ### Commit your file ###

    <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5019152/185752922-10b240d2-b90c-4629-94d6-d8b39c7ff96c.png' height="300" />

    Select **Create a New Branch**, as shown in the figure. And **Propose changes**

    <img height="300" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5019152/185753115-ac9bca3f-073a-4431-9163-55bbba36569f.png">
    
    Next, **Draft pull request** or **Create pull request**. If you want to keep editing, don't want to be merged right away, choose Draft.
    
4. ### You made it! ###


    If the translation is good, your contribution will be merged into the codebase, 👀 and you will see it in the next version of the app. 
    
    The language selection dialog shows the translation progress in a specific language, so let's collaborate to accomplish more! 🎉
